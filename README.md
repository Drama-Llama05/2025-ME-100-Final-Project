Smart IoT-Based Tool Cabinet


A MicroPython-driven smart tool cabinet that automates access control, tool tracking, and logging for shared engineering workshops. The system uses ESP32 microcontrollers, RFID readers, motion sensors, buzzers, LEDs, and a servo-driven lock to secure tools, authenticate users, and maintain a real-time inventory log accessible over Wi‑Fi.

## Features

- **User Authentication & Access Control**: Scan personal RFID cards to disarm the cabinet and unlock via a servo motor.
  - Currently authorized users:
    - "A1745C3EB7"   : Sticker   : Not Yet Assigned
    - "42455C3E65"   : Sticker   : Not Yet Assigned
    - "43975C3EB6"   : Sticker   : Not Yet Assigned
    - "B56F5C3EB8"   : Sticker   : Not Yet Assigned
    - "72475C3E57"   : Sticker   : Not Yet Assigned
    - "31395C3E6A"   : Sticker   : Not Yet Assigned
    - "E8B05B3E3D"   : Sticker   : Not Yet Assigned
    - "68585C3E52"   : Sticker   : Not Yet Assigned
    - "786E5C3E74"   : Sticker   : Not Yet Assigned
- **Tool Tracking**: RFID tags on tools combined with load-cell measurements detect check‑outs and returns.
- **Real-Time Logging**: Tag taps are timestamped and appended to a CSV (`log.csv`) on each ESP32; logs are served over HTTP.
- **Visual & Audible Alerts**:
  - Green LED: cabinet unlocked/disarmed.
  - Flashing Red LED & Buzzer: cabinet armed or failed authentication.
- **Motion‑Sensitive Activation**: PIR motion sensor enables the RFID reader only when a user is present to reduce Wi‑Fi interference.

## Prerequisites

1. **MicroPython firmware** installed on each ESP32 (version 1.20+ recommended)
2. **Wi‑Fi network credentials** for logging and HTTP server
3. **WebREPL** (optional) for remote REPL access
4. **Thonny**, **ampy**, or **rshell** for file uploads

---

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/lab‑security‑iot.git
   cd lab‑security‑iot
   ```

2. **Install driver library**

   - Copy `lib/mfrc522.py` onto each ESP32’s `/lib` folder.

3. **Configure Wi‑Fi**

   - In each `main.py`, update `SSID` and `PASSWORD` constants with your network credentials.

4. **Deploy code to ESP32s**

   ```bash
   ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put rfid_scanner/main.py main.py
   ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB1 put buzzer_alarm/main.py main.py
   # ...repeat for other modules
   ```

5. **Reset boards**

   - Each ESP32 will print its IP and start its main loop automatically.

## Usage

- Point your browser to `http://<ESP32_IP>/` (shown in REPL) to download the CSV log of all RFID tag events.
- Scan your RFID card to unlock; subsequent scans log tool tags in `log.csv` with timestamps.
- Observe LEDs and buzzer for status and alerts.
